## Abstract

The project focuses on developing a robot controlled by hand gestures, enabling it to explore environments that are difficult for humans to reach. The robot is equipped with a camera for live video recording, and hand signals are used to control its movements. The goal is to create a reliable and accurate hand gesture recognition system.

## Proposed Work

In this project, we propose the development of a robot model with a chassis that can be controlled via hand signals. We achieve this by integrating live video recording into the robot and sending hand signals to control its movements. The robot is built using Arduino, a motor driver shield, a breadboard, chassis, wheels, DC motors, and jump wires. The software components include the Arduino IDE and Python for communication.

## Importance

The significance of this work lies in the robot's ability to explore dark and challenging environments where humans cannot easily venture. It has the potential for applications in various fields, including search and rescue missions, industrial inspections, and more.

## Result

We have successfully developed a hand gesture-controlled robot with high accuracy in movement. The robot can explore its surroundings and send data to a remote receiver for further analysis.

# Comparison with Existing Methods

Our model achieved a 90% success rate in controlling the robot's movements. We used a wired connection for signal transmission, whereas some literature reviews suggest remote control via Arduino. The performance and reliability of our model are comparable to existing methods.

# Performance Analysis

We conducted a performance analysis of our hand gesture robot, considering various parameters such as run speed, dataset training accuracy, signal catching strength, distance accuracy, working accuracy, and position. The analysis results are as follows:

| Parameter          | Accuracy (%) |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Run Speed          | 98           |
| Dataset Training   | 95           |
| Signal Strength    | 90           |
| Distance Accuracy  | 92           |
| Working Accuracy   | 99           |
| Position Accuracy  | 80-85        |

# Conclusion

Despite some minor errors and challenges, our hand gesture robot demonstrates good overall performance. Further improvements can be made in terms of budget allocation, circuit enhancements, and code optimization. Hand gesture robots hold promise for future technology development.
